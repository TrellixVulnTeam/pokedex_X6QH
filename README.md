# pokedex
[Personal Project] - Pokedex
- A web and SMS app taht allows users to text the name of a Pokemon and receive information about the Pokemon. Just like a Pokedex from the anime (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex)

# Summary
- Two years ago when I was Sophomore at UC Irvine, I came across this article Build your own Pokédex with Django, MMS and PokéAPI
(https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/11/build-your-own-pokedex-with-django-mms-and-pokeapi.html). It was until now Summer 2018 that I finally had time to build this application.

- I followed the tutorial and the idea, but I decided to challenge myself by changing the technology the tutorial used. Instead of Django and Heroku I used Flask and Google App Engine. 
This turned out challenging since I had to do different steps in implementation and deploying the application.

# Technology
- Python
- Flask
- Twilio
